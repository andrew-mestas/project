Using the awe.js library 

:Notes

+ 1x1x1 cube rendered as 1ft^3
+ z-index = 1 foot distance 
+ scene rendered out as 3d space can be manipulated based on position

Brian was mentioning using MongoDB to integrate location-based queries and its scalability also for this project do you guys want to use node with Express or Ruby with rails? What are the pros and cons?

Using the open API can bind data to objects rendered on 3d scene

​[2:54] 
Possibly using coordinates to re render objects on seen space for example when user starts log starting coordinates monitor for changes in coordinates subtract from original find out the difference from that difference gives us a number to either scale or transform each object in the space
